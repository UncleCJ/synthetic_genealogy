*Drafting scope for now:*

* Family trees
  - GEDCOM, new formats, proprietary eg. in FamilyTreeDNA web
  - Other genealogists
  - More or less reliable public collections
  - Higher order methods such as ancestral recombination graphs and tree sequences (combines with genetics)
  - Hard, factual relationship structure
  - Unified mesh out of the primitive mother-father-child motif
* Genetics
  - Biological mechanism
    - Diploid genome, unphased sequence
    - Base pairs versus morgan
    - Sex chromosomes and mitochondria
      - Mutation rate
      - Relation to patronymikon
      - Relationship motif constraints ("X-matches")
    - Meiosis and fertilisation
      - Haploid gametes (half genome)
      - Crossover (probability in sperm vs egg)
  - Matches (siloed in different sites)
    - Estimated relationship distance ("what are the odds")
    - Match metrics (common SNPs, longest match)
    - Common matches
      - Clustering - geneticaffairs (improving, but originally a crude binary adjacency matrix)
      - Pitfall - population segments
      - Triangulation
        - Segments matching for three or more people ...
        - ... or estimated relationship distance
  - "DNA painting" / "Chromosome browser"
    - Plot match segments
    - Deduce ancestor contributions from match segments and vice versa (hypothetically apply other methods recursively for ancestors)
  - Phasing
    - Particularly applicable for three whole-siblings (but hypothetically useful in a "fuzzy" fashion)
    - Learn crossover loci (edges of match segments)
    - Learn grandparent "mosaic" (reconcile with matches)
    - Allen's interval algebra
  - Actual SNP sequences
    - Private!
    - Deduce their and ancestor segments
* Public records
  - Accessibility
    - Proprietary, subscription and compilations

  - Ancestry and composition
  - Cultural heritage
* Health
  - Heritable disease
  - Susceptibilities and advice
  - Other phenotypes
    - Appearance (facial quantization?)
* Forensic
  - Need to pinpoint ancestors (and their descendants) of perpetrators at scale
