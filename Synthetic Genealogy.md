*Drafting scope for now:*

* Family trees
  - GEDCOM, new formats, proprietary eg. in FamilyTreeDNA web
  - Other genealogists
  - More or less reliable public collections
  - Higher order methods such as ancestral recombination graphs and tree sequences (combines with genetics)
  - Hard, factual relationship structure
  - Unified mesh out of the primitive mother-father-child motif
* Genetics
  - Matches (siloed in different sites)
    - Estimated relationship distance ("what are the odds")
    - Match metrics (common SNPs, longest match)
    - Common matches
      - Clustering - geneticaffairs
      - Pitfall - population segments
      - Triangulation
  - "DNA painting" / "Chromosome browser"
    - Plot match segments
    - Deduce ancestor contributions from match segments and vice versa (hypothetically apply other methods recursively for ancestors)
  - Phasing
    - Particularly applicable for three whole-siblings (but hypothetically useful in a "fuzzy" fashion)
    - Learn recombination loci (edges of match segments)
    - Learn grandparent "mosaic" (reconsile with matches)
  - Actual SNP sequences
    - Private!
    - Deduce their and ancestor segments
* Public records
* Private knowledge, photos, anecdotes etc
* History / geography
* Forensic
